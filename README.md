bk-bot is a recreational bot created for entertainment purposes for Discord (a VoIP Application).

Functions

  - !atk !def : Can be used for deciding which operator to play in a game called Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.
  - !rps      : Rock, paper, scissors
  - !roll     : Roll a random number
      - This is rigged in a way which those who hold the "Administrator" roll, will always randomly roll a higher number.
      - Otherwise, there is a one in four chance the bot will properly roll a random number between 0-999
  - !mynums   : Specifically made for a friend who always asks someone to choose three random numbers. It is essentially the same
                as !roll
